About

OpenDUNE is an open source re-creation of the popular game "Dune II",
 originally made by Westwood Studios, and released by Virgin Entertainment.
It attempts to re-create the original game and apply modern technology to it
 to allow it to be run natively on most operating systems.

OpenDUNE is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. For
 more information, see the COPYING file included with every release and source

Supported Platforms
-------------------
OpenDUNE is written in ANSI C (C89), and only requires SDL to run. In result,
 OpenDUNE should run on all platforms supported by SDL.
Currently we official support the following platforms:

  - Linux
  - Mac OS X (PPC and Intel, 10.4+)
  - Windows


Requirements
------------
OpenDUNE requires LibSDL to run. For most platforms we supply SDL in our
 binary package (either in a static way, or by supplying SDL.dll). The only
 exception is Linux, where you have to install LibSDL via your pacakge manager
 yourself (in most cases, it will already be installed).


Installation & Running
----------------------
Extract OpenDUNE.
Copy the original Dune2 1.07eu data files (including dune2.exe) to data/. All
 filenames should be lowercase for case-sensitive file systems (Linux, MacOSX).
Start 'opendune'.
