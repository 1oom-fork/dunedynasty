Enhancement over Dune2
======================
When OpenDUNE is started in enhanced mode (default), a lot of bugs and
 problems which are in the original Dune2 version, are fixed.

Below is the complete listing of all those bugs and problems, per category.
 Every entry describes the problem, where the solution is in all cases
 obvious by the way the problem is described and therefore the solution is
 not mentioned as such.


Structure
---------
- When building a Wall, the owner-bits are not cleared correctly, which in
    theory could mean a Wall build by you could show up as owned by Sadukar.
- When building a structure completely on slabs, it still degrades. This seems
    in contrast with the idea of slabs.
- When building a structure, only the fog is removed (with a radius of 2) from
    the first tile defined in the layout of the structure. This is mostly
    noticable with Palace and Oil Refinery, leaving parts of them in the fog.
- Windtraps that have less than 50% hp still produce 50% of the power, even so
    the GUI tells you differently. Of course the GUI makes more sense in this
    case.
- Repair cost calculation is unfair. Dune2 uses a 256 float-resolution,
    meaning that you get rounding errors very fast. In result, Palace costs
    nothing to repair, and a windtrap costs 2 credits instead of 3 credits per
    repair tick. In detail: (2 * 256 / hitpoints) * credits / 256. The first
    part causes rounding errors.
- If one structure gives a script error, all structures after it in the linked
    list are not handled. This doesn't really seem correct.
- In Script function which finds the closest unit to target, it doesn't pick
    the closest unit within range, but the one with the highest index within
    range.
- Too many tile colours are remapped with house colours, causing graphical
    issues with the IX building. It maps 0x90 .. 0xA0 instead of 0x90 .. 0x96.


Scenario
--------
- A mistake in reading the '+' causes repeat for reinforcements to be always
    false. In result reinforcement is only send once.
- The structure '% hitpoints' is ignored. In result all structures always
    have 100% hitpoints.


House
-----
- When you have a refinery and lost all your harvesters, you get a new one even
    if you are currently building one in heavy vehicle factory.
- Silo credit capping is done outside the main house loop, causing it to only
    update the house which owns the latest structure. This allows you to go
    over your silo capacity most of the time, and then losing it all of a
    sudden (when you start building a structure).


Teams
-----
- If a team gives a script error, all other teams are aborted.


SaveLoad
--------
- The save routine allowed a NAME chunk up to 65536 bytes, where 255 bytes
    should be sufficient for any sane name (both excluding the \0).


General
-------
- The screen telling if you have the security question wrong/right is there
    for such short time, you never really see it.
