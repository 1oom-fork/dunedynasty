Enhancement over Dune2
======================
When OpenDUNE is started in enhanced mode (default), a lot of bugs and
 problems which are in the original Dune2 version, are fixed.

Below is the complete listing of all those bugs and problems, per category.


Scenario
--------
- A mistake in reading the '+' causes repeat for reinforcements to be always
    false. In result reinforcement is only send once.
- The structure '% hitpoints' is ignored. In result all structures always
    have 100% hitpoints.
- Original scenario files uses 'Track' and 'Wheel' where it should be
    'Tracked' and 'Wheeled'. In result only infantry teams up.
