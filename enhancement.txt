Enhancement over Dune2
======================
When OpenDUNE is started in enhanced mode (default), a lot of bugs and
 problems which are in the original Dune2 version, are fixed.

Below is the complete listing of all those bugs and problems, per category.


Structure
---------
- When building a Wall, the owner-bits are not cleared correctly, which in
    theory could mean a Wall build by you could show up as owned by Sadukar.
- When building a structure completely on slabs, it still degrades. This seems
    in contrast with the idea of slabs.
- When building a structure, only the fog is removed (with a radius of 2) from
    the first tile defined in the layout of the structure. This is mostly
    noticable with Palace and Oil Refinery, leaving parts of them in the fog.
- Windtraps that have less than 50% hp still produce 50% of the power, even so
    the GUI tells you differently. Of course the GUI makes more sense in this
    case.

Scenario
--------
- A mistake in reading the '+' causes repeat for reinforcements to be always
    false. In result reinforcement is only send once.
- The structure '% hitpoints' is ignored. In result all structures always
    have 100% hitpoints.
